# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this plan is to consider and then present the information and components necessary to effectively teach a computer science related class.

## Context

### Course

I will be teaching Data Science, an Algebra 2 alternative math course that incorporates some computer science related topics like coding. Data Science is typically taken by students in grades 10-12. I am currently teaching the class and hope to continue teaching it in the future. 
From the curriculum website: *This curriculum will introduce students to the main ideas in data science through free tools such as Google Sheets, Python, Data Commons and Tableau. Students will learn to be data explorers in project-based units, through which they will develop their understanding of data analysis, sampling, correlation/causation, bias and uncertainty, probability, modeling with data, making and evaluating data-based arguments, the power of data in society, and more! At the end of the course students will have a portfolio of their data science work to showcase their newly developed abilities.* [Explorations in Data Science](https://hsdatascience.youcubed.org/)

### Situation

This is the second year that the course is being offered at our school and in our district. I and another teacher have been working to incorporate all the parts in the curriculum. Some challenges have included the limited permissions students have using their school issued chromebooks and the school's Wifi. For example, the video player used in the course is Vimeo, which is blocked for students. Also, some of the curriculum's preferred applications require special permissions for use because of privacy concerns, for example we got special permission to turn on access to Google Colab. All students have their own devices, chromebooks, most of which are an ASUS model. In my classroom I also have access to several working desktop computers which use a similar chromebook start up which enables students to load their profiles through Google. Each student and staff member in my district has a Google account. The Wifi at school is very reliable. Our district also works to enable students to have access to the internet at home to use their devices. The demographics at my school are very typical of suburban Southern California, with minority students representing the majority of students, and about 50% Free and Reduced Lunch eligible. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

The software I am using and hoping to use in the future includes:
* Google Classroom - I use Google Classroom as my LMS for posting instructions, assignments, and information to and communicating with students.
* Google Mail - I use Gmail as another form of communication with students and their parents.
* Synergy - My school district uses Synergy for a gradebook. I post grades for assignments using this application (not Google Classroom).
* Google Sheets, Documents, Slides - I use the Google suite for presentations, assignments, instructions, and activities.
* Nearpod - I have used Nearpod for "lecturing" and assignments.
* Google Colab - The curriculum uses Google Colab as a way to show students code and have students run code for assignments.
* Data Commons - We will be getting data from Data Commons.
* CODAP - We have used CODAP to analyze data and create visuals.
* Scratch - I have used Scratch to introduce students to basic coding (some students in the class have experience with coding and some do not).
* Microsoft Windows - My work computer as well as all the computers my students have access to from the school use Windows. There is at least one of my students that is currently using a Mac Book in class, but she also has a school issued chromebook if necessary.

### Hardware Specifications

Each of my students needs access to a computer. Beyond that, there are no hardware requirements I can think of. We do not use CDs, flash drives, or other equipment, everything for the class is delivered online. Occasionally I print a copy of something for students so that they have it physically to mark up or reference. So maybe a printer, which I have in the classroom. I also have a Smart Board that I use for projection and that the students can use for presentations.

My current district issued laptop is a Lenovo L570 with the following specifications:
Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz   2.70 GHz
Installed RAM	8.00 GB (7.90 GB usable)
Edition	Windows 10 Enterprise Version	22H2

My students currently have each have a school issued HP Chromebook with the following specifications:

(This is what I was able to access given that I don't have access to all settings because I do not have administrator privileges. 

### Application

The course is broken down into units. In each unit there is a different focus which incorporates a different set of objectives, activities, and projects. There are no "tests" in the class. The assignments and projects are completed sometimes in groups, sometimes pairs, and sometimes individually. 

I often create a Google Document or Google Slides that includes information and instructions for the days learning activities. It might include links to videos, Sheets, or websites. Alternatively, I create a Nearpod that we move through as a class synchronously, or that the students move through asynchronously.

Each day I post the materials I have created to the Google Classroom, in the Classwork Tab, with the Unit specified, most recent on top. I post the materials as an "assignment" if there will be a deliverable that they can attach to "turn in". If I am just providing materials that day, then I post as "materials". For example, I might require some work and a visual created for some data in a Google Sheet, they would be able to attach that to the assignment, making it instantly visible to me so that I can view, grade, display, or comment on it. Alternatively, if the material for the day was a Nearpod lesson, I would go to my Nearpod account and verify that it was completed with an acceptable percentage of accuracy/completeness. This allows for students to access materials at any time from any location. So if they are absent they can still see what they should be doing for the day. It also allows students to review materials covered previously, or make things up if needed. Using the Google Suite also allows students to easily work together on Documents, Slides, or Sheets. I can also easily open any materials and display them on my Smartboard.

Each unit usually incorporates some sort of presentation where students are able to view each other's work. Discussion and reflection are big focuses of the course. There are opportunities for peer and instructor feedback, rubrics, and resubmitting. The end of each unit requires students to incorporate a summary of their learning for the unit in a slide in their "portfolio" which includes a description, links to work, and images that represent the unit's content.

### Impacts

I think that having all materials online increases access for students who may have issues with attendance. Providing it in a way that is visible for the entirety of the course allows students to go back and re-read or re-watch lessons. Having 1-1 chromebook access allows all students access to the content. There are some issues with privacy, for example the Scratch site does not have a signed privacy agreement with my district, so students are not allowed to sign in, but they can still use the site to experiment, they just can't save their work. Tableau was another challenge, I was able to get a year long cloud site, but I was not able to get students to view it the traditional way because their Gmail accounts don't accept emails from outside of the district. Part of each unit in the curriculum encourages students to think about the ethics of the data, programs, and applications that they are using.
